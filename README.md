# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository serves as a **central portfolio index** for all my **Data Science and Machine Learning projects**.  
Each project is hosted in its **own dedicated GitHub repository**, and this repo provides a single, organized view of my complete work.

The portfolio covers **EDA, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Model Evaluation, Optimization techniques, and an end-to-end Capstone Project**.
